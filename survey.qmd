- DATASET-01 Video files from embarked cameras (video)
- DATASET-02 Deep learning models and training datasets applied on the videos (models, dataset);
- DATASET-03 Surveys of fishers, local ecological knowledge and associated cultural values (dataset);
- DATASET-04 Local reference DNA sequence database for genetic analyses(dataset);
- DATASET-05List of species found through meta-barcoding (stomach contents) (dataset);
- DATASET-06 List of species found through meta-barcoding (eDNA) (dataset);
- DATASET-07 NetCDF files of bioacoustic data (dataset);
- DATASET-08 Deep learning models and training datasetsapplied on the bioacoustic data(models, dataset);
- DATASET-09 NetCDF files of echosounder buoys data (dataset);
- DATASET-10 NetCDF files of WBAT echosounder data (dataset);

## Dataset listing

Could you list for each dataset and WP the following informations ?

-   Type of data collected and protocols associated
-   Where the protocols are stored
-   Where the data are stored (IRD Drive, MARBEC-DATA...) ?
-   Which archive we can use for the publication ?
    -   for example, DL models on github and the output data on the [MOOBYF community host on zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/moobyf-biodiversa/)
-   Do you know a metadata standard to describe the data collected ?

## Expected data sizes

The amount of data generated depends in large part on which sequencing technologies are available at the time of sample submission.

MOOBYF is prepared for the secure storage of 1 Tb of data, which can be extended.
