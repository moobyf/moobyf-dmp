# Data collection and Digital outputs

## Purpose of data collection

Data collection and research are in accordance with the objective of the project which is to develop monitoring platforms to observe the open ocean and its biodiversity in collaboration with fishers.

More information are available online :

-   Biodiversa+ : <https://www.biodiversa.eu/2024/04/15/moobyf/>
-   MOOBYF Communuties on Zenodo : <https://zenodo.org/communities/moobyf-biodiversa/>

## Data collection

### Primary data

Primary data are the raw data collected during the project before any processing or analysis.

#### Bioacoustic data

Data will be collected using SNAP recorders, deployed with a pre-programmed recorder to capture 10-minute sequences every hour over the course of a week.
The data type is a WAV format.

#### Temperature-Depth Recorder data

TDR Data collected using STARODDI archival tags. A dedicated protocol for tag deployment and data retrieval is in preparation.
Data is downloaded using the Seastar (Staroddi) Software, Version 9.45.
A dedicated R script is used to read and plot the TD data.
The data are stored in DAT file as numeric.

#### Echosounder data

Echosounder data are collected throug two type of buoys : 
1. Marine Instruments M3i+ buoys.
  - A dedicated protocol for buoy deployment and data download is in preparation. The downloading needs to use the MSB Software (Marine Instruments), Version 5.0.
  
  - The data are stored in CSV file as numeric. They will read and process through a dedicated R script to dertmine the presence/absence of tuna.

2. Simrad WBAT echosounder.
  - A dedicated protocol for buoy deployment and data download is in preparation. The downloading needs to use the Matecho and Movies3D Softwares (under Matlab environment), version Matecho20240821V7 and Movies3D2.2.16
  
  - The data are stored in EK80 CW or EK80 FM files format. This raw data coming from WBAT Echosounder acquisition must be convert in HAC format (DYYYYMMDD-THHMMSS-X.hac), the ICES HAC Standard Data Exchange Format and then into Matlab HDF5 format with Matecho Software. 

#### Surveys data

The data will be collected through qualitative methods, including focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and observations. The data will on different types like textual documents (such as Interviews, observations) images, audio and video recordings. [ATLAS.ti](https://atlasti.com/fr) software will be used for coding and analyzing the collected data.

#### Video data

The data are collected with 4 IP cameras situated approximately 1.3 m below the surface. 
The buoy will be programmed to film at different durations/frequencies to assess the best sampling protocol to detect species nearby the AFAD. 

#### Deep learning model data

An annotated dataset of video images will be constructed using an annotation software to label the species of interest in each frame. From this dataset, a deep learning model will be developed and trained using state-of-the-art architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 

#### DNA data

During the project, the content stomach and eDNA samples will be collected and analysed through metabarcoding methods. The dataset resulting will be a list of species.

### Secondary data

The responsibility for managing secondary and working datasets, as well as storage, lies with the partners, with guidance provided by the DMB. These datasets are usually generated through analysis pipelines and can be reproduced by applying specific analyses, pipelines, or scripts. The final outputs of these processes are essential for reports, publications, and other deliverables.

### Other data

#### Photos

::: callout-note
I think its mandatory to be compliant with GDPR
:::

Photos collected within the project will include the photographer's name in the file naming convention to ensure proper attribution. By submitting photos to the project directories, partners acknowledge that their name *will* be publicly credited if/when the photos are used in presentations, publications, or communications, supporting transparent credit attribution.

For photos featuring people, they can only be submitted if explicit permission is obtained from those depicted. The initials of the individuals must be included in the file name, and their full names should be documented in the file MOOBYF_photos_README. The photographer is responsible for ensuring that everyone featured in a photo understands that their image and, optionally, their name *will* be publicly visible if/when the photo is used for presentations, publications, or communications.

## Expected data sizes

The amount of data generated depends in large part on which sequencing technologies are available at the time of sample submission.

MOOBYF is prepared for the secure storage of 1 Tb of data, which can be extended.

# Data identifiers {#sec-data-identifier}

## Unique Site Identifiers

We need to define an ID for site in purpose to keep on track our data and the sample. I propose somthing based on MT + CC + TS.

| USID | Description    |
|------|----------------|
| MT   | Methodology    |
| CC   | Country Code   |
| TS   | Targeted Site  |

: Components of the Unique Site ID

| Methodology     | Code |
|-----------------|------|
| bioacoustics    | BA   |
| echosunder buoy | MI   |
| wbat            | WB   |

: Country Codes for samples

| Country   | ISO 3166-1 Alpha-3 |
|-----------|--------------------|
| Indonesia | IDN                |
| Mayotte   | MYT                |
| Maldives  | MDV                |

: Country Codes for samples

| Targeted site  | Site code |
|----------------|-----------|
| Gondol         | GO        |
| Captive fish   | CF        |
| FAD1 in Pancer | F1P       |

: Site used as case studies

## Sampling naming conventions

A proposition is to adopt a name of the folders based on the USID defined above, for example:

BA_IDN_F1P_Q1_S1 where S1 is the sample number (it can be for example a depth where we put an hydrophone, or a camera number) Then, we would have a metadata table (one per methodology, for example, one table for BA=bioacoustics), with the following info (one column per item):

-   Folder_name
-   File name
-   Latitude
-   Longitude
-   Date start
-   Date end
-   Distance from buoy to FAD

# Data security, Storage & Costs

## During the project

-   Non-personal data backup : All MOOBYF data will be stored on a secure data storage (MARBEC_NAS) to prevent data loss and data security.
-   Personal data: Stakeholder personal data should be collected and stored using the backup system of his insititute.
-   IRD Drive : MOOBYF has a shared directory on IRD Drive with a proficient backup system. Use of this product is controlled direclty by the IT staff at IRD and they managed the access with at a user level.

## Long-term

Deposit of data in recognized public data repositories is a priority. Data and other digital outputs will be made available following FAIR standards.

## Costs

-   Costs for the safe storage of primary data are assumed by the coordinator at IRD, other costs are assumed by the Partners. Costs are covered by IRD until all data has been submitted to online repositories.
-   Partners assume responsibility for their local costs of data backup, security and storage of primary data copies, secondary data and scripts.

## Data Organization

### Primary data

Directory structure and naming conventions will be established and
updated by the DMB prioritizing FAIR principles. 
Directory and file names are expected to use the PrID when applicable (see @sec-data-identifier). 

### Secondary data

These data are generated at Partner institutions and must adhere to Institutional requirements for Directory structure and naming conventions where applicable. To share these data among Partners (directly, via Zenodo Community or other) or with other approved recipients, the conventions for primary data must be applied.

# Data use & sharing

## General principles

Datasets will be formatted and made accessible at the time of publication or before according to the community standards and will follow FAIR principles.

## Within project data & digital output sharing

### Primary data

All data and metadata will be produced by individual Partner institutions and shared on a common platform or promptly transferred as digital copies to the IRD for backup. Additionally, copies of raw data may be made available as specified in Section 6.1 during the project period.

The project coordinator and the DMB representative at IRD will have access to these datasets and will provide data to Partners upon request, with one exception:

If a data request extends beyond the defined responsibilities of a Partner’s project role (as outlined in the MOOBYF application), the DMB will review the request before granting access. Access will be approved if all the following conditions are met:
1. The data request aligns with and supports MOOBYF’s goals and objectives.
2. Accessing the data does not interfere with the rights and responsibilities of other Partners within the project.
3. Formal, mutually agreed arrangements—such as co-authorship, collaboration, or other fair agreements—are confirmed via email to the DMB.

### Secondary data

Data generated by partner institutions should be made accessible to all partners following the same principles and criteria established for Primary Data (as described above).

Data sharing can be conducted through any secure method unless specified otherwise by the DMB or in future updates to the DMP.

<!-- ## Public access to data and digital outputs -->

```{=html}
<!-- ###  Scientific papers

We prioritize publishing open access. Papers will be made publicly available from the time of publication. 
By mutual agreement among authors, the pre-publication version may be made publicly available via a field-appropriate and recognized pre-print archive.

### Data that is the basis of Scientific papers: 

To support publication, datasets relied on for scientific papers will be deposited in public repositories 
and made publicly available upon formal publication (does not include pre-review or
pre-print versions).

The lead author and corresponding author of each manuscript is responsible for
coordinating with the DMB and other work groups and authors to ensure that the data
access is made public upon publication. -->
