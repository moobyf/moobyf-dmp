# DMB

## Membership, responsibilities, and scope

DMB will develop, implement, and update an operational MOOBYF Data Management Plan, support adherence to the DMP, and ensure the MOOBYF DMP meets research community, partner institution, national and EU standards.

-   The DMB is composed of (minimum) one representative from each Partner institution. See @sec-dmb-listing for membership record.
-   DMB meets 2 times per year (virtually), with interim virtual meetings and digital communications as needed.

# Data and Digital outputs

## Purpose of data collection

Data collection and research are in accordance with the objective of the project which is to develop monitoring platforms to observe the open ocean and its biodiversity in collaboration with fishers.

More information are available online :

-   Biodiversa+ : <https://www.biodiversa.eu/2024/04/15/moobyf/>

## Data types collected

### Primary data

#### Video

#### DNA

#### Photos

::: callout-note
Are you agree
:::

Photos collected within the project will be matched with the name of the photographer
through the file naming convention, ensuring correct attribution for the photographer.
By submitting photos to the project directories, it is understood by partners
 that their name WILL be public as the photo credit if/when their photos are
used for presentations, publications, and communications to support
correct and transparent attribution of credit.

In the case of photos that include people, they can only be submitted to the project if
expressed permission from those pictured is provided. The initials of the person/people
must be reported through the naming convention and their full name included in the file
MOOBYF_photos_README. The photographer is responsible for ensuring that every
pictured person understands that their photo and name (optional) WILL be public if/
when the photos are used for  presentations, publications, and
communications.

## Expected data sizes

The amount of data generated depends in large part on which sequencing technologies are available at the time of sample submission.

MOOBYF is prepared for the secure storage of 1 Tb of data, which can be extended.

# Data collection

## Primary data

::: callout-note
Define primary data before write this section
:::

## Secondary data

Secondary and working datasets and storage fall under the responsibility of
the partners with guidance from the DMB. These datasets are typically derived from analysis
pipelines and can be recreated by applying analysis/analyses, pipelines, or scripts. End
products of these processes that are relied upon for reports/publications/etc...

# Data identifiers

## Unique Site Identifiers

We need to define an ID for site in purpose to keep on track our data and the sample. 
I propose somthing based on CC + TS + ST. What else is interesting to add ?

| USID | Description    |
|------|----------------|
| CC   | Country Code   |
| TS   | Targeted Site  |
| ST   | Sample type    |

: Components of the Unique Site ID

+--------------+---------------------+
| Country      | ISO 3166-1 Alpha-3  |
+==============+=====================+
| Indonesia    | IDN                 |
+--------------+---------------------+
| Mayotte      | MYT                 |
+--------------+---------------------+
| Maldives     | MDV                 |
+--------------+---------------------+
|              |                     |
+--------------+---------------------+

: Country Codes for samples

| Targeted site | Site code |
|---------------|-----------|
| Gondol        |           |
|               |           |
|               |           |
|               |           |

: Site used as case studies


## Sampling naming conventions

We need to define a naming convention to be sure don't messup the file.
I propose something like that: (is it sufficient ?)

[USID]_[YYYYMMDD]_[###]_[status]_[version_number].ext

where: 

- the version date (use ISO 8601 format: YYYYMMDD)
- Experiment number or sample ID is '###'
- status is raw, processed, draft, final
- use a version number (e.g. “v01” or “v02”)

# Data security, Storage & Costs

## During the project

::: callout-note
Need to write the section
:::

## Long-term

Deposit of data in recognized public data repositories is a priority. Data and other digital outputs will be made available  following FAIR standards.

## Costs

-   Costs for the safe storage of primary data are assumed by the coordinator at IRD, other costs are assumed by the Partners.
-   Partners assume responsibility for their local costs of data backup, security and storage of primary data copies, secondary data and scripts.

::: callout-note
Costs after the end of the project ?
:::

## Data Organization

### Primary data 

::: callout-note
Need to write the section
:::

### Secondary data 

These data are generated at Partner institutions and must adhere to
Institutional requirements for Directory structure and naming conventions where
applicable. To share these data among Partners (directly, via Zenodo Community or
other) or with other approved recipients, the conventions for primary data must be
applied.

# Data use & sharing

::: callout-note
Need to write the section
:::

## General principles

Datasets will be formatted and made accessible at the time of publication or
before according to the community standards and will follow FAIR principles.

## Within project data & digital output sharing

### Primary data

### Secondary data

These data are generated at partner institutions and are expected to
be available among partners following the same principles and criteria
as for Primary Data (above). 

Sharing can be achieved by any secure method unless otherwise noted as excluded by the DMB and future versions of the DMP.

## Public access to data and digital outputs

###  Scientific papers

We prioritize publishing open access. Papers will be made publicly available from the time of publication. 
By mutual agreement among authors, the pre-publication version may be made publicly available via a field-appropriate and recognized pre-print archive.

### Data that is the basis of Scientific papers: 

To support publication, datasets relied on for scientific papers will be deposited in public repositories 
and made publicly available upon formal publication (does not include pre-review or
pre-print versions).

The lead author and corresponding author of each manuscript is responsible for
coordinating with the DMB and other work groups and authors to ensure that the data
access is made public upon publication.
